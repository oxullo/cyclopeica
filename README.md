CYCLOPEICA
==========

Limited bandwidth ticker device

Abstract
-------

Information availability and its richness has tremendously grown since internet has gone
public.
Cyclopeica puts the user in a playful and critical perspective where the access bandwidth
to content is reduced to an essential minimum.
News feeds, weather forecasts, data picked up randomly from the net are streamed onto its
single, fancy old-timer russian character display.

Cyclopsulator, a cyclopic emulator
-----------------------------

This repo currently hosts an emulator (*cyclopsulator*), built as proof of concept for the hardware device (*cyclopeica*).

Cyclopsulator is based on [libavg](http://www.libavg.de) and a couple other very handy libraries.

Cyclopeica
---------

A possible implementation of Cyclopeica might be composed of:

* ATMega MCU
* Ethernet controller
* One ИВ-17 VFD

If cyclopeica will be ever built, this repo will host firmware, schematics and server-side code as well.
